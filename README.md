# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters.

## ✅ Features Used:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔄 Steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature standardization
- Train-test split
- Model training (SVM)
- Accuracy evaluation
- Predictive system creation

---

## 📥 Dataset:
The dataset is available from Kaggle:  
👉 [PIMA Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Download the following two files** from this repository:
   - `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`
   - `diabetes.csv` (from the Kaggle link above)

2. **Open Jupyter Notebook** (locally or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)).

3. **Upload both files** into the same working directory.

4. **Run the notebook** cell by cell to view data analysis, training process, accuracy, and prediction system.
